# Ruang Meeting (React Native CLI)

How to run

1. Install dependencies with your package manager (npm or yarn). Example:

````bash
cd /Volumes/project-danu/Technical-Test/technical-test-ftl
npm install
# or yarn
# yarn install
# Ruang Meeting (Expo-enabled)

This project was adapted so you can start it with Expo.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies (npm or yarn):

```bash
cd /Volumes/project-danu/Technical-Test/technical-test-ftl
npm install
# or
yarn
````

3. Run on device/emulator (requires native toolchain):

```bash
npm run android
npm run ios
```

Notes

- If you don't have the Expo CLI installed globally, the scripts use the local `expo` package (or you can run `npx expo start`).
- The app entry is `App.js` (Expo will pick it up). If you need a bare workflow (pure React Native CLI) instead, I can prepare instructions.

If anything fails during `npm install`, share the error and I will help diagnose.
